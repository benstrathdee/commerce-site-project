# commerce-site-project

A mock commerce site made using React, vaguely imitating IKEA's site design. This was created to test our abilities to interact with REST APIs in React.

# Instructions

To run, download the files and run the following commands in the main directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should start up a local instance of the site, and if my Firebase database is still up, the site should have about 10-20 products available to fiddle around with.
